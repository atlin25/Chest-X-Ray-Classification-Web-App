# Chest-X-Ray-Classification-Web-App
This project develops a CNN model for classifying chest X-ray images to detect abnormalities using the VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection dataset from Kaggle. The model, achieving 80% accuracy, is integrated into a web application for user interaction as well. Limitations including class imbalance, dataset validity, and GPU constraints.
